            <p>In this episode I was joined by Britney and Leslie, hosts of Black and Bold Podcast.
                We spoke about the effects of sexual assault as well as uncomfortable experiences both of them have been
                through.</p>

            <p>This is a very serious topic and healthy dialogue is needed to continue to educate ourselves.

                <h2> ABOUT US </h2>

                <p>The aim of this podcast is to encourage Christians in their walk with God.
                    Our motto, Kingdom over Culture is grounded in Romans 12:2 when Paul says: </p>

                <p>"Do not copy the behaviours and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by
                    changing the way you think.
                    Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect." </p>

                <p>We believe that to truly be the salt of the world, we can not conform to the culture, but rather we need to
                    walk in the new creation that we are in Christ.</p>
